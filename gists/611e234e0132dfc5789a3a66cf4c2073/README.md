This is an experiment with sorting the polygons of a voronoi diagram. They sort on a logarithmic scale because a linear scale was causing them to cluster all to one side in a progressively more compact way. The sorting is by the area of the shape - which is also represented by color. After moving to the new location, the sort is re-calculated based on the new shapes and the shapes move again. This was the result of reading <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock">Mike Bostock's</a> article on <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/">Visualizing Algorithms</a>.
