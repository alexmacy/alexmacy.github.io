JavaScript and D3.js have their own means for sorting and one may never need to use traditional sorting algorithms when developing in JavaScript. So I made this for comparing sorting algorithms in an environment that is more familiar to me. 

It's a bit of an off-shoot of the Mergesort series I did here: 
<a href="http://bl.ocks.org/alexmacy/d6f48eb15d4608c3a71b7681309ebf8c">Mergesort w/ color</a> & <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/alexmacy/9f109c383f8ed21f5f610cb21113ca68">Mergesort animation</a>. I left Mergesort out here because it doesn't work very well with the way I wanted to visualize these. Instead, I used insertion sort, selection sort, bubble sort, and bogosort just for fun.


* Update 10/9/16: Added Mergesort.
