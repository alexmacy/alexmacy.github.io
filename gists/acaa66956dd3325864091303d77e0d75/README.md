This is another version of this block: <a href='http://bl.ocks.org/alexmacy/15962e97f7a9ebacd55710bf277593d4'>Force-Directed Voronoi Graph</a>, but with the polygons hidden. This is an experiment in making it easier to drag the nodes. Clicking anywhere selects the closest node instead of having to click directly on the node.

From the previous block:

This is a fork of <a href='http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/'>mbostock</a>'s block: <a href='http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045'>Force-Directed Graph</a> where I've added a voronoi overlay. This could have a practical use by not having to click directly on a node in order select it and drag it.

From the original block:

This simple force-directed graph shows character co-occurence in *Les Misérables*. A physical simulation of charged particles and springs places related characters in closer proximity, while unrelated characters are farther apart. Layout algorithm inspired by [Tim Dwyer](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~tdwyer/) and [Thomas Jakobsen](http://web.archive.org/web/20080410171619/http://www.teknikus.dk/tj/gdc2001.htm). Data based on character coappearence in Victor Hugo's *Les Misérables*, compiled by [Donald Knuth](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/sgb.html).
