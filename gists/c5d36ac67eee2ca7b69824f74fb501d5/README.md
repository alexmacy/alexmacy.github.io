This is the second in a series exploring how to calculate and display the combinations of multiple waves. See the previous block <a href='http://bl.ocks.org/alexmacy/03547a3e7498dbe3690b7eb35578022b'>Compound Waves</a>. This requires finding the least common multiple of the frequencies, which can get pretty heavy to process. This version uses adds a radial line to display the compound wave. This is very much restricted by the capabilities of SVG, which is why this one only has inputs for two frequencies - but the transitions are kinda nice... 


More to come!
