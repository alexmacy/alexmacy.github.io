This is an experiment in manipulating audio at the bit level, using the Web Audio API. It's also a kind of homage to a Alvin Lucier's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Sitting_in_a_Room">I am Sitting in a Room</a>. The original was created by re-recording an audio track while it was being played back into the room it was originally recorded. The main effect was that the room's resonant frequencies became much more prominent with each iteration, resulting in something that doesn't sound at all like the original recording. 

I cropped his 'clean' recording for the sake of better performance in the browser, and preselected some delay offsets to create a similar effect. Instead of responding to resonant frequencies, this introduces four offset copies of the track every time it repeats. 

You can skip ahead by clicking the 'Apply Effect' button, but beware, it can get very loud!
