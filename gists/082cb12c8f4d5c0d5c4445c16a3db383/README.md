This is another riff on projection transitions, based on <a href='http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/'>mbostock</a>'s block: <a href='http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3711652'>Projection Transitions</a>.
This one uses a slider to allow for manually controlled transitions. The map can also be rotated by clicking and dragging.
