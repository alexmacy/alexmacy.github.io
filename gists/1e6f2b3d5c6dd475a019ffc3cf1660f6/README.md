Partially an update to one of <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/alexmacy/06cf037853999219cd82bc79edc4aee6">my previous blocks</a>, the original intention here was to more clearly convey what is happening during the transitions between shapes by drawing lines from the vertices of the old shape to those of the new shapes. 

It uses a kinda-sorta add-on I made called <a href="https://github.com/alexmacy/d3-shape-tween">d3-shape-tween</a>, which helps smoother transitions between complex shapes, especially when transitioning between shapes of varying complexity.

I also had some fun experimenting with rotating the shape as if it's on a turntable...
