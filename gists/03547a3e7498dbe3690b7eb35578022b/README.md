This is the beginning of exploring how to calculate and display the combinations of multiple waves. This requires finding the least common multiple of the frequencies, which can get pretty heavy to process. 

Adjust the sliders to change frequency combinations. But watch out with some of the more complicated waves, sometimes the least common multiple can get above 1 million! (e.g. 79, 80, 81)
