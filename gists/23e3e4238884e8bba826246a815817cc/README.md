The buttons at the top let you add more charts and snap them to the screen tiled to all be visible. The charts are also interactive in that they can be resized and moved. They are also responsive to mouseover events, using [voronoi.find()](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi#diagram_find) to highlight the cell in each chart for the mouse's relative location.
