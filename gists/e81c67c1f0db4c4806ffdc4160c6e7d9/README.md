This is a quick test of a tooltip that is responsive to the curser and also avoids the edges so that it is always visible. A more practical example can be seen here: [Election History w/ Avoidant Tooltip](https://bl.ocks.org/alexmacy/4d8168d038e0a75cfaf33cf290f51458).

If you can manage to click on the tooltip, the screen flashes!
