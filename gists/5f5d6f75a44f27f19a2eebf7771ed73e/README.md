This is an experiment in manipulating audio at the bit level, using the Web Audio API. It's also a kind of homage to a couple Steve Reich pieces: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_Out_(Reich)">Come Out</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Gonna_Rain">It's Gonna Rain</a>. Where Reich spliced audio tape, this offsets the second track on each repetition, thus creating the phase. 

* The select menu at the top left selects between the two pieces.
* Another select menu adjusts the phase offset/rate of change.
* The 'One Step' button lets you skip forward if you get impatient.
* And the 'Reset' button brings the two tracks back into phase.
