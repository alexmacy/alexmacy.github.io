This is a sort of interactive version of <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/alexmacy/1e6f2b3d5c6dd475a019ffc3cf1660f6">Rotating Shape Transitions</a>. 

You can adjust the rotational speed on the left, select form the color palette on the right, and chose between drawing a line or multiple small circles.

Interesting things start to happen at certain speeds, both with how the lines get drawn and how they appear.
